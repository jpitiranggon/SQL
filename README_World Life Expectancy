In this project, I utilized SQL to clean, prepare, and analyze a World Life Expectancy dataset.

Questions I was interested in answering:
1. What was the lowest and highest life expectancy for each country in the last 15 years?
2. Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy?
3. Is there a correlation between BMI and life expectancy?

My analysis consisted of:
1. Identifying and removing duplicate records.
2. Filling missing fields with appropriate data where possible.
3. Running queries to answer questions and identify information.
4. Utilizing case statements to categorize data.

## Key Takeaways:
- There is a high correlation between GDP and life expectancy.
- Countries with a high GDP consistently had a significantly higher life expectancy than those with a lower GDP.
- Shockingly, there was a low correlation between BMI and life expectancy. Countries with higher life expectancies consistently had much higher BMIs in the obese range according to the CDC.
- Life expectancies increased for all countries over the span of the last 15 years. This is likely due to the advancement of modern medicine and a growing GDP.
