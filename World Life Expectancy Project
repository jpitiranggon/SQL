#This is a project I completed on world life expectancy data. After taking a glance through the data, I completed a data cleaning to identify and remove duplicate records, and fill in missing items when appropriate. When the data cleaning was completed, I began an exploratory data analysis to discover different insights and correlations through SQL queries.
